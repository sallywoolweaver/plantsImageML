# 🌱 Plant Detector – Student Guide (YOLO + Raspberry Pi Images)

## 0. Big Picture – What You’re Doing

You are training a **YOLO object detection model** to recognize your plants from Raspberry Pi photos.

Pipeline:

1. Get your **Pi images onto the server**
2. Use `define_masks.py` to **draw polygons** around each plant in some images  
3. Convert those polygons into **YOLO labels** using `convert_masks_to_yolo.py`
4. Check the dataset structure
5. Train YOLO with `plant_data.yaml`
6. Run predictions + debug what the model is doing

You will work in **your own folder**, named after you, so you don’t affect anyone else’s work.

---

## 1. Create Your Personal Project Folder & Clone the Template

You will each have your own folder on the server Desktop, named with **your name**.

### 1.1 Make your folder on the Desktop

From a terminal on the server:

```bash
cd /home/compsci/Desktop

# Replace YOUR_NAME with something like sally, lauren, evan, etc.
mkdir YOUR_NAME_plants
cd YOUR_NAME_plants
```

Now you are inside your own working folder:

```bash
/home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants
```

### 1.2 Clone the template repo into your folder

Your teacher will give you the repo URL, which looks like:

```text
https://github.com/.../plants-ml-template.git
```

Run:

```bash
cd /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants

git clone <https://github.com/sallywoolweaver/plantsImageML> .
```

> The final `.` means “clone into the **current** folder”.

Now run:

```bash
ls
```

You should see files like:

```text
convert_masks_to_yolo.py
debug_model.py
define_masks.py
file_structure.py
plant_data.yaml
yolov8n.pt / yolo11n.pt   (base models)
```

> ❗ Do **NOT** push your large images or model weights back to Git unless your teacher tells you to. They stay on the server.

---

## 2. Use the Shared Python Environment (venv)

A Python **virtual environment** is already set up on the server with all required libraries (ultralytics, matplotlib, pillow, etc.).  
You will **reuse** that environment so we don’t reinstall packages 30 times.

From **your folder**:

```bash
cd /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants
source /home/compsci/Desktop/plants/.venv/bin/activate
```

You should now see:

```bash
(.venv) compsci@compsci-System-Product-Name:~/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants$
```

If you don’t see `(.venv)` at the left, you forgot to activate the environment.

You must activate the venv **every time** you open a new terminal session.

---

## 3. Know Where Your Raspberry Pi Images Are

Your Pi will upload images into a folder like:

```bash
/home/compsci/Downloads/rasppiupload-1-002/rasppiupload
```

Ask your teacher **which folder is yours**, and write it down.

We will call it:

```text
/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR_PI_IMAGES
```

Example:

```text
/home/compsci/Downloads/rasppiupload-1-002/rasppiupload
```

You’ll use this exact path in multiple commands.

---

## 4. What is `plant_data.yaml` and What is YAML?

A **YAML file** (`.yaml` or `.yml`) is a plain-text **configuration file** that tells a program:

- where things are  
- what options/settings to use  
- what names to associate with numeric IDs

For YOLO, **`plant_data.yaml`** tells it:

- Where your dataset lives  
- Where the training and validation images are  
- What each **class ID** means (e.g., `0 = Plant 1`, `1 = Plant 2`)

Example `plant_data.yaml`:

```yaml
path: /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants/plants_yolo_dataset

train: images/train
val: images/val

names:
  0: Plant 1
  1: Plant 2
  2: Plant 3
```

Breakdown:

- `path:` → absolute path to your dataset root (inside **your** folder)
- `train:` → subfolder for training images (relative to `path`)
- `val:` → subfolder for validation images (relative to `path`)
- `names:` → mapping from class **index → human-readable label**

⚠ **Rules of YAML:**

- Indentation matters; use **spaces only**, not tabs  
- `key: value` pairs define settings  
- Don’t randomly add tabs or change alignment, or it will break

You will need to edit only the `path:` line so it points to **your folder**, not your teacher’s.

---

## 5. Step 1 – Label Plants with `define_masks.py`

You will draw **polygons** around each plant in some images. This “teaches” the model where the plants are.

From your folder:

```bash
cd /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants
source /home/compsci/Desktop/plants/.venv/bin/activate
```

Run:

```bash
python define_masks.py   "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR_PI_IMAGES"   masks.json   --plant_ids 1 2
```

- `"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR_PI_IMAGES"` → your Pi image folder path  
- `masks.json` → file where all polygon annotations will be saved  
- `--plant_ids 1 2` → which plants you are labeling (Plant 1, Plant 2).  
  - If you have 3 plants, you might use `--plant_ids 1 2 3`.

### 5.1 Controls in the Labeling Window

For **each plant** on each image:

- **Left click** → add a point (vertex) of the polygon  
- **Enter** → finish the polygon for this plant and move to the next plant ID  
- **Backspace** → undo the last point  
- **Esc** → clear the current polygon and start that plant again  
- **Q** → quit labeling early

Label at least **10–20 good images** where the plants are clearly visible. This will be your training data.

Result: a `masks.json` file in your folder that contains all your polygons.

---

## 6. Step 2 – Convert `masks.json` → YOLO Dataset (`convert_masks_to_yolo.py`)

YOLO expects bounding boxes in `.txt` label files, not polygons.  
`convert_masks_to_yolo.py` converts your polygons into YOLO’s label format and builds the dataset folders.

From your folder:

```bash
cd /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants
source /home/compsci/Desktop/plants/.venv/bin/activate

python convert_masks_to_yolo.py   masks.json   "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR_PI_IMAGES"   --out_root plants_yolo_dataset
```

What this script does:

- Reads your polygons from `masks.json`  
- Matches them with image files in your Pi folder  
- Converts polygons → bounding boxes (YOLO format)  
- Creates:

```text
plants_yolo_dataset/
  images/
    train/
    val/
  labels/
    train/
    val/
```

Now you have a **train/val split** and labels ready for YOLO.

If you forget arguments, you can always run:

```bash
python convert_masks_to_yolo.py -h
```

to see help.

---

## 7. Step 3 – Fix `plant_data.yaml` for YOUR Folder

Open `plant_data.yaml` in your folder and change the `path:` line:

```yaml
path: /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants/plants_yolo_dataset

train: images/train
val: images/val

names:
  0: Plant 1
  1: Plant 2
  # 2: Plant 3   # uncomment/add if you have 3 plants
```

Do **not** change `train:` and `val:` unless told to.

After this, YOLO will know:

- Where your dataset is (in your folder)  
- What class IDs exist and what to call them

---

## 8. Step 4 – (Optional) Check Dataset Structure with `file_structure.py`

To catch missing labels or mismatched files, run:

```bash
cd /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants
source /home/compsci/Desktop/plants/.venv/bin/activate

python file_structure.py
```

This helper script will typically:

- Check that every image in `images/train` has a corresponding label in `labels/train`  
- Do the same for `val`  
- Print warnings if anything is broken

Fix any issues it reports **before** training.

---

## 9. Step 5 – Train the YOLO Model

Time to train your plant detector.

```bash
cd /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants
source /home/compsci/Desktop/plants/.venv/bin/activate

yolo detect train   model=yolov8n.pt   data=plant_data.yaml   epochs=30   imgsz=640   batch=16   device=0
```

Arguments:

- `model=yolov8n.pt` → start from the small pre-trained YOLO model  
- `data=plant_data.yaml` → your dataset config  
- `epochs=30` → how many times to go through the training data  
- `imgsz=640` → resize images to 640×640  
- `batch=16` → number of images per training step  
- `device=0` → use GPU 0 (the RTX card)

When done, check:

```text
runs/detect/train/
  weights/
    best.pt   # best model on validation set
    last.pt   # final model after last epoch
```

Use **`best.pt`** for evaluation and demos.

---

## 10. Step 6 – Run Predictions on Your Images

### 10.1 Visual predictions with YOLO CLI

To draw bounding boxes on your validation images:

```bash
cd /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants
source /home/compsci/Desktop/plants/.venv/bin/activate

yolo detect predict   model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt   source="plants_yolo_dataset/images/val"   conf=0.25
```

YOLO will create a folder:

```text
runs/detect/predict/
  image1.jpg   # with boxes and labels drawn
  image2.jpg
  ...
```

Open these images (on the server) and check:

- Are your plants detected?
- Are the labels correct (Plant 1 vs Plant 2)?

If your model is missing plants, try lowering the confidence threshold:

```bash
yolo detect predict   model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt   source="plants_yolo_dataset/images/val"   conf=0.10
```

**Concept:**  
- Higher `conf` → fewer, more certain detections (higher precision)  
- Lower `conf` → more detections (higher recall) but possibly more incorrect ones

---

## 11. Step 7 – Debug Predictions with `debug_model.py` (IB-Level Understanding)

For IB, you must be able to explain:

- What predictions the model is making  
- How confident it is  
- How you evaluated it

Use `debug_model.py` to see the raw predictions:

```bash
cd /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants
source /home/compsci/Desktop/plants/.venv/bin/activate

python debug_model.py   runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt   "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/ONE_TEST_IMAGE.jpg"
```

Example output:

```text
image 1/1 ... image(1022).jpg: 384x640 1 Plant 1, 1 Plant 2, 15.1ms

=== Result 0 ===
Image: /home/compsci/Downloads/.../image(1022).jpg
  Box 0: class=0 conf=0.511 xyxy=[...]
  Box 1: class=1 conf=0.100 xyxy=[...]
```

Interpret this:

- `class=0` → Plant 1  
- `class=1` → Plant 2  
- `conf=0.511` → about 51% confidence  
- `conf=0.100` → only 10% confident about Plant 2 (very unsure)

If `conf` is lower than your chosen threshold (e.g., 0.25), YOLO’s visual prediction command will **hide** that box, even though the model “suspected” it.

This is great evaluation material:

- How thresholds affect what you see  
- Why some true plants don’t appear in the visualization  
- How to discuss precision vs recall in your write-up

## 12. Common Errors & How to Troubleshoot

### ❌ Error: “FigureCanvasAgg is non-interactive, and thus cannot be shown”

You might be:

- Running `define_masks.py` over SSH or without a graphical session, or  
- In the wrong environment/backend.

Make sure:

- You are physically at the server machine (with monitor & keyboard), **not** SSH’d in  
- You activated the `.venv`

Your teacher has already configured a working interactive backend.

---

### ❌ Error: “FileNotFoundError: ... image(123).jpg”

Check:

- The path you passed as `"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR_PI_IMAGES"` is correct  
- The filenames in `masks.json` actually exist in that folder  
- You didn’t mistype the path or forget quotes

---

### ❌ Error during training about `data=plant_data.yaml`

Likely causes:

- `path:` in `plant_data.yaml` points to the wrong place  
- You renamed your folder but didn’t update YAML  
- Indentation error in the YAML file

Double-check:

```yaml
path: /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants/plants_yolo_dataset
train: images/train
val: images/val
```

No tabs. Use spaces.

---

### ❌ “No labels found” or strange training results

- Did `convert_masks_to_yolo.py` run without errors?  
- Do you have `.txt` files in `plants_yolo_dataset/labels/train` and `/val`?  
- Run:

```bash
python file_structure.py
```

to spot missing/mismatched labels.

---

## 13. Quick Command Cheat-Sheet

Replace `YOUR_NAME` and paths where needed.

```bash
# 1) Go to your folder
cd /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants

# 2) Activate environment
source /home/compsci/Desktop/plants/.venv/bin/activate

# 3) Label plants
python define_masks.py "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR_PI_IMAGES" masks.json --plant_ids 1 2

# 4) Convert to YOLO dataset
python convert_masks_to_yolo.py masks.json "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR_PI_IMAGES" --out_root plants_yolo_dataset

# 5) Fix plant_data.yaml (set path: to /home/compsci/Desktop/YOUR_NAME_plants/plants_yolo_dataset)

# 6) (Optional) Check dataset
python file_structure.py

# 7) Train model
yolo detect train model=yolov8n.pt data=plant_data.yaml epochs=30 imgsz=640 batch=16 device=0

# 8) Visual predictions
yolo detect predict model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt source="plants_yolo_dataset/images/val" conf=0.25

# 9) Debug predictions
python debug_model.py runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/ONE_TEST_IMAGE.jpg"
```

You can copy/paste these and just replace `YOUR_NAME` and the Pi image path with your own values.

Good luck—and remember, part of the goal is **understanding** what the model does and where it fails, not just getting perfect green boxes.
